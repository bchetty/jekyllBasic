Note:From now on, you guys don't have to stuff me with ads anymore, when you are greedy and want the needs of others to the point of swooning, and my IDs are not that you have already stolen, not that you can possess everything you want, because everything I set out is a declaration, if I cheat by my own actions, what will disappear by itself, but if any day someone hacks into the database that has been placed, you or you guys will only get the name of the ID, in other parts, if anyone steals cracks or hacks it, the damaged link will no longer be visible, but it will appear. It is a tool that will lead the authorities directly to you, as for me, what are you fighting for when you are crooked and refuse to help, it is not enough, but it is also a scramble if it really helps, it will be like this, cheating all over the place from head to tail, if it really thinks about helping, it will not be in such a bad condition because it intends to cheat since it asks to migrate the data to its house, but it does not move the owner of the data with it, it is an excuse that should not be taken as a claim, that I am not on the server, I am the owner of the server from the beginning, but you use state power to intimidate and/or coerce it into belonging to your people, this is really disgraceful. professional certificate  They got it by copying? That's easy. What country supports copying projects and can take away projects that belong to their owners? And you also encourage fathers and mothers to teach their children and grandchildren to cheat at a young age. Are you the one who talks so loudly that you are superior to anyone and can control the whole world, so you are cheating.  This Gunny that I granted and typed it like this, I'll see which face dares to steal it from me again.  It's so obvious that there's only one place where they hire other people to hack and then pretend to be a coincidence.  By chance, why did your dad come to my job and every job!!!!!  I'm not afraid either. I've been watching for a long time to see how those big, goosenecked guys will come out and deal with them.  Fuck, I'm safe, but I'm not saving my work. Everything is good.  What are you going to watch out for with me alone?  Other people took my job and money without paying attention.  Some work is worth a lot, but taking it just for the reason that it's bought is really unreliable. Don't fall for them. Even if they almost ask for information, drag me to ruin here in one place, one roll is finished.  But "Wikipedia", when that bastard came in and urged me to hurry up and post my work, I knew about you because you wrote my backdoor work to the max. I saw all of you because at that time I was the owner.  So you can see every movement and history just by entering. I try to preserve history without letting anyone embellish it, but when you take it away, it's ruined. No one trusts Wikipedia because you alone will.  Tell me where it comes from.  From "Google+" How about that? Isn't that right? Pussy dog ​​(that's you, Jim)
